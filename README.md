# Simpson's 1/3rd Rule Numerical Method Calculator

## Overview

This project is a web application that implements Simpson's 1/3rd rule, a numerical method for estimating the definite integral of a function. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap for responsive design.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting the function and limits of integration.
- Real-time calculations of the integral using Simpson's 1/3rd rule.
- Responsive design compatible with desktop and mobile devices.
- Clean and intuitive layout using Bootstrap components.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic of Simpson's 1/3rd rule.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and UI components.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simpsons-rule-calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd simpsons-rule-calculator
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Enter the function you want to integrate (e.g., `x^2`, `sin(x)`).
2. Specify the lower and upper limits of integration.
3. Click the "Calculate" button to see the result.
4. The estimated value of the integral will be displayed on the screen.

## Example

Given the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) and limits from 0 to 1, the application will use Simpson's 1/3rd rule to calculate the integral:

\[
\int_{0}^{1} x^2 \, dx
\]

### Result
The estimated value of the integral will be shown after clicking the "Calculate" button.
