# Simpson's 1/3rd Rule Numerical Method Calculator

## Overview

This project is a web application that implements Simpson's 1/3rd rule, a numerical method for estimating the definite integral of a function. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap for responsive design.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting the function and limits of integration.
- Real-time calculations of the integral using Simpson's 1/3rd rule.
- Responsive design compatible with desktop and mobile devices.
- Clean and intuitive layout using Bootstrap components.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic of Simpson's 1/3rd rule.
